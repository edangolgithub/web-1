        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (About this soundlisten)) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating
        from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all
        animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for
        Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1]
        ation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced
        animation.
